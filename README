#   Final Project: Pacman
# ----------------------------------------------

Description of Project:
    We created a Pacman recreation on the arduino. Our game requires has the user choose
    a diffuculty at the beginning of each game. The three diffuculties effect hwo many lives
    you have and how fast the ghosts will move at. Another change we made in our game is
    the ghosts are able to move through walls but pacman is confined to paths on the map.
    The ghosts move towards pacman at all times if they ever overlap each other they teleport
    back to one of the ghosts starting postions. When the player runs out of lives by being
    touched by the ghosts too many times the player will play through a lights minigame similar
    to simon says where the player must copy what the lights displayed on the led. Once the
    minigame is finished. The player is able to see how their score stacked up with previous
    highscores. If the player wants to play the game again they may press the joystick again
    to prompt for inputing name and play the game.

Running Instructions:
    1) enter the file directory of Pacman client and type make upload into the terminal
    2) enter the "Highscores" directory and enter "make"
    3) type ""./highscores" in the terminal
    4) the terminal should prompt you to enter a name
    5) after entering a name, follow the instructions on the LCD display
    6) Play our version of pacman!
    7) When game is over and you see the list of higscores press joystick to play again
    8) going through from Steps 4) to 8)
